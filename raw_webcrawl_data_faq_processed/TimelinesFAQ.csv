Which agent starts a global snapshot algorithm?,"The algorithm is started by any one or more agents. The agents that start the algorithm isn't specified. The agent that should initiate a snapshot algorithm is usually self evident from the application of the algorithm. For example, an agent that has been waiting for a long time for a message may obtain a global snapshot to determine if the agent is in a deadlock."
"Can the snapshot algorithm be used to record the states and channels of a subset of agents, or does the algorithm have to span all agents and channels?",The snapshot algorithm can be used to record the states of a connected subset of agents. An agent doesn't propagate markers to agents outside the set of interest. The recorded states of the subset of agents and channels forms a part of a global snapshot. Some algorithms only used snapshots of subsets of agents.
"Is ""every message received in past is sent in past"" equivalent to ""every message sent in future is received in future""?",Yes. Note that a message may be received in the final state.
